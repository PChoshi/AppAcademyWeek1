      <div class="paragraph"><p>My name is Carol Mahlangu, and cooking has been a part of me for as long as I can 
remember. From a young age, I found joy in the kitchen—watching, learning, and 
eventually creating my own dishes with love and curiosity. What started as a 
childhood passion has grown into a lifelong calling.
Food is more than just nourishment to me—it’s a story, a memory, a celebration. I 
cook with heart, drawing from tradition, creativity, and a desire to bring people 
together. Whether it’s a hearty stew, soft steamed bread, or a beautifully plated 
salad, every dish I make is crafted with care and intention.
Over the years, I’ve refined my craft not just through experience, but through 
listening to those I cook for. I’ve served meals at private events, created comforting 
food for families, and developed signature sauces and seasoning blends that 
elevate simple meals into unforgettable experiences. </p></div>
